msgid ""
"When running tests with an Oracle database, Django creates a temporary "
"database user. In older versions, if a password isn't manually specified in "
"the database settings ``TEST`` dictionary, a hardcoded password is used. "
"This could allow an attacker with network access to the database server to "
"connect."

"Older versions of Django don't validate the ``Host`` header against "
"``settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS`` when ``settings.DEBUG=True``. This makes them "

"While Django doesn't ship a module that allows remote code execution, this "
"is at least a cross-site scripting vector, which could be quite serious if "
"developers load a copy of the production database in development or connect "
"to some production services for which there's no development instance, for "
"example. If a project uses a package like the ``django-debug-toolbar``, then "
"the attacker could execute arbitrary SQL, which could be especially bad if "
"the developers connect to the database with a superuser account."

"``settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS`` is now validated regardless of ``DEBUG``. For "
"convenience, if ``ALLOWED_HOSTS`` is empty and ``DEBUG=True``, the following "
"variations of localhost are allowed ``['localhost', '127.0.0.1', '::1']``. "
"If your local settings file has your production ``ALLOWED_HOSTS`` value, you "
"must now omit it to get those fallback values."
