"If an admin user has the change permission to the user model, only part of "
"the password hash is displayed in the change form. Admin users with the view "
"(but not change) permission to the user model were displayed the entire "
"hash. While it's typically infeasible to reverse a strong password hash, if "
"your site uses weaker password hashing algorithms such as MD5 or SHA1, it "
"could be a problem."
