":mod:`django.contrib.sessions` currently uses :mod:`pickle` to serialize "
"session data before storing it in the backend. If you're using the :ref:"
"`signed cookie session backend<cookie-session-backend>` and :setting:"
"`SECRET_KEY` is known by an attacker (there isn't an inherent vulnerability "
"in Django that would cause it to leak), the attacker could insert a string "
"into his session which, when unpickled, executes arbitrary code on the "
"server. The technique for doing so is simple and easily available on the "
"internet. Although the cookie session storage signs the cookie-stored data "
"to prevent tampering, a :setting:`SECRET_KEY` leak immediately escalates to "
"a remote code execution vulnerability."

"This attack can be mitigated by serializing session data using JSON rather "
"than :mod:`pickle`. To facilitate this, Django 1.5.3 introduces a new "
"setting, :setting:`SESSION_SERIALIZER`, to customize the session "
"serialization format. For backwards compatibility, this setting defaults to "
"using :mod:`pickle`. While JSON serialization does not support all Python "
"objects like :mod:`pickle` does, we highly recommend switching to JSON-"
"serialized values. Also, as JSON requires string keys, you will likely run "
"into problems if you are using non-string keys in ``request.session``. See "
"the :ref:`session_serialization` documentation for more details."
