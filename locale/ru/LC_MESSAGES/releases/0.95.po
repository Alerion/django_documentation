"The major changes in this release (for developers currently using the 0.91 "
"release) are a result of merging the 'magic-removal' branch of development. "
"This branch removed a number of constraints in the way Django code had to be "
"written that were a consequence of decisions made in the early days of "
"Django, prior to its open-source release. It's now possible to write more "
"natural, Pythonic code that works as expected, and there's less \"black magic"

"It's now possible to use Django without a database. This simply means that "
