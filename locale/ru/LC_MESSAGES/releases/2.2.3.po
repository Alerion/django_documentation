msgid ""
"When deployed behind a reverse-proxy connecting to Django via HTTPS, :attr:"
"`django.http.HttpRequest.scheme` would incorrectly detect client requests "
"made via HTTP as using HTTPS. This entails incorrect results for :meth:"
"`~django.http.HttpRequest.is_secure`, and :meth:`~django.http.HttpRequest."

"in accordance with :setting:`SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`."

"If you deploy Django behind a reverse-proxy that forwards HTTP requests, and "
