"When using Django sessions, Django will set a ``Vary: Cookie`` header to "
"ensure caches do not serve cached data to requests from other sessions. "
"However, older versions of Internet Explorer (most likely only Internet "
"Explorer 6, and Internet Explorer 7 if run on Windows XP or Windows Server "
"2003) are unable to handle the ``Vary`` header in combination with many "
"content types. Therefore, Django would remove the header if the request was "
"made by Internet Explorer."

"To remedy this, the special behavior for these older Internet Explorer "
"versions has been removed, and the ``Vary`` header is no longer stripped "
"from the response. In addition, modifications to the ``Cache-Control`` "
"header for all Internet Explorer requests with a ``Content-Disposition`` "
"header have also been removed as they were found to have similar issues."
