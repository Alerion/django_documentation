"The Django administrative interface, ``django.contrib.admin``, supports "
"filtering of displayed lists of objects by fields on the corresponding "
"models, including across database-level relationships. This is implemented "
"by passing lookup arguments in the querystring portion of the URL, and "
"options on the ModelAdmin class allow developers to specify particular "
"fields or relationships which will generate automatic links for filtering."

"One historically-undocumented and -unofficially-supported feature has been "
"the ability for a user with sufficient knowledge of a model's structure and "
"the format of these lookup arguments to invent useful new filters on the fly "
"by manipulating the querystring."

"However, it has been demonstrated that this can be abused to gain access to "
"information outside of an admin user's permissions; for example, an attacker "
"with access to the admin and sufficient knowledge of model structure and "
"relations could construct query strings which -- with repeated use of "
"regular-expression lookups supported by the Django database API -- expose "
"sensitive information such as users' password hashes."

#: ../../releases/1.2.4.txt:45

"To remedy this, ``django.contrib.admin`` will now validate that querystring "
"lookup arguments either specify only fields on the model being viewed, or "
"cross relations which have been explicitly whitelisted by the application "
"developer using the pre-existing mechanism mentioned above. This is "
"backwards-incompatible for any users relying on the prior ability to insert "
"arbitrary lookups."

"One of the bugs fixed in Django 1.2.4 involves a set of circumstances "
"whereby a running a test suite on a multiple database configuration could "
"cause the original source database (i.e., the actual production database) to "
"be dropped, causing catastrophic loss of data. In order to provide a fix for "
"this problem, it was necessary to introduce a new setting -- :setting:"
"`TEST_DEPENDENCIES` -- that allows you to define any creation order "
"dependencies in your database configuration."
