"In older versions, HTML autoescaping was disabled in a portion of the "

"Django 1.11 inadvertently changed the sequence and trigger naming scheme on "

"The pre-1.11 naming scheme is now restored. Unfortunately, it necessarily "
"requires an update to Oracle tables created with Django 1.11.[1-4]. Use the "
"upgrade script in :ticket:`28451` comment 8 to update sequence and trigger "
"names to use the pre-1.11 naming scheme."
