"Django relies on user input in some cases (e.g. ``django.contrib.auth.views."
"login()`` and :doc:`i18n </topics/i18n/index>`) to redirect the user to an "
"\"on success\" URL. The security checks for these redirects (namely ``django."
"utils.http.is_safe_url()``) accepted URLs with leading control characters "
"and so considered URLs like ``\\x08javascript:...`` safe. This issue doesn't "
"affect Django currently, since we only put this URL into the ``Location`` "
"response header and browsers seem to ignore JavaScript there. Browsers we "
"tested also treat URLs prefixed with control characters such as ``%08//"
"example.com`` as relative paths so redirection to an unsafe target isn't a "
"problem either."

"However, if a developer relies on ``is_safe_url()`` to provide safe redirect "
"targets and puts such a URL into a link, they could suffer from an XSS "
"attack as some browsers such as Google Chrome ignore control characters at "
"the start of a URL in an anchor ``href``."
