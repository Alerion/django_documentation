"Python 3.2 users, please be advised that we've decided to drop support for "

"Python 3.2 either. Upstream support for Python 3.2 ends February 2016 so we "
"don't find much value in providing security updates for a version of Python "
"that could be insecure. To read more about the decision and to let us know "
"if this will be problematic for you, please read the `django-developers "
