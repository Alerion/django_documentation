"Django also provides a convenience function -- ``reverse()`` -- which "
"performs this process in the opposite direction. The ``reverse()`` function "
"takes information about a view and returns a URL which would invoke that "
"view. Use of ``reverse()`` is encouraged for application developers, as the "
"output of ``reverse()`` is always based on the current URL patterns, meaning "
