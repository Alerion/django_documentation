"CVE-2016-2512: Malicious redirect and possible XSS attack via user-supplied "
"redirect URLs containing basic auth"
msgstr ""

#: ../../releases/1.9.3.txt:12
msgid ""
"Django relies on user input in some cases (e.g. :func:`django.contrib.auth."
"views.login` and :doc:`i18n </topics/i18n/index>`) to redirect the user to "
"an \"on success\" URL. The security check for these redirects (namely "
"``django.utils.http.is_safe_url()``) considered some URLs with basic "
"authentication credentials \"safe\" when they shouldn't be."
msgstr ""

#: ../../releases/1.9.3.txt:18
msgid ""
"For example, a URL like ``http://mysite.example.com\\@attacker.com`` would "
"be considered safe if the request's host is ``http://mysite.example.com``, "
"but redirecting to this URL sends the user to ``attacker.com``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../releases/1.9.3.txt:22
msgid ""
"Also, if a developer relies on ``is_safe_url()`` to provide safe redirect "
"targets and puts such a URL into a link, they could suffer from an XSS "
"attack."

"CVE-2016-2513: User enumeration through timing difference on password hasher "
"work factor upgrade"
msgstr ""

#: ../../releases/1.9.3.txt:28
msgid ""
"In each major version of Django since 1.6, the default number of iterations "
"for the ``PBKDF2PasswordHasher`` and its subclasses has increased. This "
"improves the security of the password as the speed of hardware increases, "
"however, it also creates a timing difference between a login request for a "
"user with a password encoded in an older number of iterations and login "
"request for a nonexistent user (which runs the default hasher's default "
"number of iterations since Django 1.6)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../releases/1.9.3.txt:36
msgid ""
"This only affects users who haven't logged in since the iterations were "
"increased. The first time a user logs in after an iterations increase, their "
"password is updated with the new iterations and there is no longer a timing "
"difference."
msgstr ""

#: ../../releases/1.9.3.txt:41
msgid ""
"The new ``BasePasswordHasher.harden_runtime()`` method allows hashers to "
"bridge the runtime gap between the work factor (e.g. iterations) supplied in "
"existing encoded passwords and the default work factor of the hasher. This "
"method is implemented for ``PBKDF2PasswordHasher``  and "
"``BCryptPasswordHasher``. The number of rounds for the latter hasher hasn't "
"changed since Django 1.4, but some projects may subclass it and increase the "
"work factor as needed."

#: ../../releases/1.9.3.txt:48
msgid ""
"A warning will be emitted for any :ref:`third-party password hashers that "
"don't implement <write-your-own-password-hasher>` a ``harden_runtime()`` "
"method."
msgstr ""

#: ../../releases/1.9.3.txt:51
msgid ""
"If you have different password hashes in your database (such as SHA1 hashes "
"from users who haven't logged in since the default hasher switched to PBKDF2 "
"in Django 1.4), the timing difference on a login request for these users may "
"be even greater and this fix doesn't remedy that difference (or any "
"difference when changing hashers). You may be able to :ref:`upgrade those "
"hashes <wrapping-password-hashers>` to prevent a timing attack for that case."
