"CVE-2017-7233: Open redirect and possible XSS attack via user-supplied "
"numeric redirect URLs"
msgstr ""

#: ../../releases/1.10.7.txt:12
msgid ""
"Django relies on user input in some cases  (e.g. ``django.contrib.auth.views."
"login()`` and :doc:`i18n </topics/i18n/index>`) to redirect the user to an "
"\"on success\" URL. The security check for these redirects (namely ``django."
"utils.http.is_safe_url()``) considered some numeric URLs (e.g. "
"``http:999999999``) \"safe\" when they shouldn't be."

"Also, if a developer relies on ``is_safe_url()`` to provide safe redirect "
"targets and puts such a URL into a link, they could suffer from an XSS "
"attack."
