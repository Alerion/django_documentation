msgstr ""

#: ../../releases/1.11.10.txt:12
msgid ""
"A regression in Django 1.11.8 made :class:`~django.contrib.auth.forms."
"AuthenticationForm` run its ``confirm_login_allowed()`` method even if an "
"incorrect password is entered. This can leak information about a user, "
"depending on what messages ``confirm_login_allowed()`` raises. If "
"``confirm_login_allowed()`` isn't overridden, an attacker enter an arbitrary "
"username and see if that user has been set to ``is_active=False``. If "
"``confirm_login_allowed()`` is overridden, more sensitive details could be "
"leaked."

#: ../../releases/1.11.10.txt:21
msgid ""
"This issue is fixed with the caveat that ``AuthenticationForm`` can no "
"longer raise the \"This account is inactive.\" error if the authentication "
"backend rejects inactive users (the default authentication backend, "
"``ModelBackend``, has done that since Django 1.10). This issue will be "
"revisited for Django 2.1 as a fix to address the caveat will likely be too "
"invasive for inclusion in older versions."
