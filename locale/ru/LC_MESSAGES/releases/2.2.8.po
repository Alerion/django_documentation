msgid "CVE-2019-19118: Privilege escalation in the Django admin."
msgstr ""

#: ../../releases/2.2.8.txt:13
msgid ""
"Since Django 2.1, a Django model admin displaying a parent model with "
"related model inlines, where the user has view-only permissions to a parent "
"model but edit permissions to the inline model, would display a read-only "
"view of the parent model but editable forms for the inline."
msgstr ""

#: ../../releases/2.2.8.txt:18
msgid ""
"Submitting these forms would not allow direct edits to the parent model, but "
"would trigger the parent model's ``save()`` method, and cause pre and post-"
"save signal handlers to be invoked. This is a privilege escalation as a user "
"who lacks permission to edit a model should not be able to trigger its save-"
"related signals."
msgstr ""

#: ../../releases/2.2.8.txt:24
msgid ""
"To resolve this issue, the permission handling code of the Django admin "
"interface has been changed. Now, if a user has only the \"view\" permission "
"for a parent model, the entire displayed form will not be editable, even if "
"the user has permission to edit models included in inlines."
msgstr ""

#: ../../releases/2.2.8.txt:29
msgid ""
"This is a backwards-incompatible change, and the Django security team is "
"aware that some users of Django were depending on the ability to allow "
"editing of inlines in the admin form of an otherwise view-only parent model."
msgstr ""

#: ../../releases/2.2.8.txt:33
msgid ""
"Given the complexity of the Django admin, and in-particular the permissions "
"related checks, it is the view of the Django security team that this change "
"was necessary: that it is not currently feasible to maintain the existing "
"behavior whilst escaping the potential privilege escalation in a way that "
"would avoid a recurrence of similar issues in the future, and that would be "
"compatible with Django's *safe by default* philosophy."
msgstr ""

#: ../../releases/2.2.8.txt:40
msgid ""
"For the time being, developers whose applications are affected by this "
"change should replace the use of inlines in read-only parents with custom "
"forms and views that explicitly implement the desired functionality. In the "
"longer term, adding a documented, supported, and properly-tested mechanism "
"for partially-editable multi-model forms to the admin interface may occur in "
"Django itself."
