"CVE-2017-7233: Open redirect and possible XSS attack via user-supplied "
"numeric redirect URLs"
msgstr ""

#: ../../releases/1.9.13.txt:13
msgid ""
"Django relies on user input in some cases  (e.g. :func:`django.contrib.auth."
"views.login` and :doc:`i18n </topics/i18n/index>`) to redirect the user to "
"an \"on success\" URL. The security check for these redirects (namely "
"``django.utils.http.is_safe_url()``) considered some numeric URLs (e.g. "
"``http:999999999``) \"safe\" when they shouldn't be."

"Also, if a developer relies on ``is_safe_url()`` to provide safe redirect "
"targets and puts such a URL into a link, they could suffer from an XSS "
"attack."
