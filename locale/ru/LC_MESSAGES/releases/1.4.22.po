"Previously, a session could be created when anonymously accessing the "
"``django.contrib.auth.views.logout()`` view (provided it wasn't decorated "
"with :func:`~django.contrib.auth.decorators.login_required` as done in the "
"admin). This could allow an attacker to easily create many new session "
"records by sending repeated requests, potentially filling up the session "
"store or causing other users' session records to be evicted."

"Additionally, the ``contrib.sessions.backends.base.SessionBase.flush()`` and "
"``cache_db.SessionStore.flush()`` methods have been modified to avoid "
"creating a new empty session. Maintainers of third-party session backends "
"should check if the same vulnerability is present in their backend and "
"correct it if so."
