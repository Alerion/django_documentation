"Django is committed to API stability and forwards-compatibility. In a "
"nutshell, this means that code you develop against a version of Django will "
"continue to work with future releases. You may need to make minor changes "
"when upgrading the version of Django your project uses: see the \"Backwards "
"incompatible changes\" section of the :doc:`release note </releases/index>` "
"for the version or versions to which you are upgrading."

"At the same time as making API stability a very high priority, Django is "
"also committed to continual improvement, along with aiming for \"one way to "
"do it\" (eventually) in the APIs we provide. This means that when we "
"discover clearly superior ways to do things, we will deprecate and "
"eventually remove the old ways. Our aim is to provide a modern, dependable "
"web framework of the highest quality that encourages best practices in all "
"projects that use it. By using incremental improvements, we try to avoid "
"both stagnation and large breaking upgrades."
