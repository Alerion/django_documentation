"Suppose an online store has a page where a logged in user can click \"Buy Now"

"button on one of their own pages, and load the store's page in a transparent "
"iframe such that the \"Buy Now\" button is invisibly overlaid on the \"I "
"Like Ponies\" button. If the user visits the attacker's site, clicking \"I "
"Like Ponies\" will cause an inadvertent click on the \"Buy Now\" button and "
